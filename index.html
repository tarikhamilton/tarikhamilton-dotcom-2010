        <h2>Freelance Web Designer</h2>
        <h3>It's cheap and it still looks nice! Sweet, man!</h3>

        <p>
          Hello and thank you for visiting! My name is Tarik Hamilton and I'm an
          aspiring computer engineer student. Having a deep appreciation for the
          internet (the power of information!) since before having a two-digit
          age, web design was something I was always attracted to. It wasn't
          long before I made my first

          .

        <p>
          The internet is a completely new medium that is very different from
          television and radio. The best part is, anyone join in on internet
          action! You don't have to have to be wealthy or a business to have a
          website; even a professional quality page can be me made for a child
          or by a child, there are no restrictions. I can help you get online
          with cheap flexible service and high quality design.

        <h2>Web Design Philosophy</h2>
        <h3>Just like humans, it's what's in the inside that counts.</h3>

        <p>
          After working on websites for over six years, I started to see that
          there were two types of designers. The one with large graphics,
          resource intensive, inflexible pages and the purists who exercise
          structure, highly accessible (for disabilities), but dreadfully dull.
          However, then there is the designer strives for both together;
          bringing accessibility to beauty and beauty to accessibility. I am one
          who strives for both. Sometimes less is more. Take Google for
          example—they're one of the most successful companies out there! Your
          website should be easy to view for
          <em>everyone</em>, including the blind (or even yourself)! I will
          always make sure your web page is <strong>up-to-date</strong> and
          displays consistantly across browsers.
